# Mule App Development Tutorial

Most integrations require a change to the structure of data as it moves from source to destination. Within a Mule app, you can use the drag-n-drop interface of the Transform Message component to map data from one field or format to another, or you can write mappings by hand within DataWeave scripts

Using a small data set and a training API available on Exchange, you’ll create a project and define the transformation mapping from the API into a different structure and protocol. You’ll use the drag-n-drop and also see the DataWeave code that defines the transformation.
